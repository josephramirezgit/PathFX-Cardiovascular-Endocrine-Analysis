# PathFX-Cardiovascular-Endocrine-Analysis

This repository contains the code for running PathFX analyses on 5 of the most commonly prescribed cardiovascular and endocrine disease related drugs. The first large block of commented code details how to run PathFX on the command line. The user will need to ensure that they have already PathFX installed on their computer.

The user should copy the code following the '$' character into their command line.

The user may have to change the read in file when doing the analysis, but the written code attempts to generalize it based on what seems most reasonable for the user to place their directories.
